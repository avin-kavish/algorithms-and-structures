## Motivation

I decided to refresh my algorithms and data structures knowledge by following
this [course by google.](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)

I spend a lot of time coding full stack applications in high level languages and pursuing business objectives; it is
easy to lose touch with some ground truths.

I'm mostly using C++ to implement these algorithms. This way I can stay in touch with fundamentals by avoiding the
comforts of VM, memory safety, GC etc.

This will be an ongoing project where I add new structures and algorithms, and improve the code to achieve optimal
operation.

## Progress

 - [x] HashSet
 - [ ] LinkedList
   - [x] SinglyLinked
